Mixing ADF with alien components
=========================================
This repository helds the code we develop on 29-Jan-2019 at Alfresco Devcon (https://devcon.alfresco.com/)
We started from a very good example of Angular real time Chat (https://github.com/luixaviles/socket-io-typescript-chat) and we extended it adding the ability to make a search against an Alfresco Content Server using the REST API.

We want to demonstrate how easy is to interact from an Angular App with Alfresco Platform and we focused on Search Service.
In particular we add the possibility to make a couple of searches:
- search document by title
- search the last documents edited by a user

All the searches are limited to the first 10 results
